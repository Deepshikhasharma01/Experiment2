Experiment 2.1 – Word Counter

Aim To create a simple web page using JavaScript that counts the number of words entered by the user in real time.

Observation When the user types inside the text area, the word count updates instantly without reloading the page. Words are counted based on spaces between them. If the text box is empty, the counter shows 0/150 Words. As more text is typed, the display changes live like 12/150 Words, 25/150 Words, etc.

Learning Outcomes

Learned to use the oninput event to run JavaScript while typing.

Understood how to get user input from a textarea using getElementById.

Learned to split a sentence into words using spaces in JavaScript.

Implemented dynamic content update on the webpage without any refresh.

Experiment 2.2 – Product Filter

Aim To build a product filtering system that shows or hides items based on a selected category using JavaScript.

Observation When a category is selected from the dropdown, only the matching products are displayed. If “All Products” is selected, every product becomes visible again. The filtering happens instantly without refreshing the page.

Learning Outcomes

Learned to use the dropdown and onchange event. Understood how to read custom attributes using getAttribute(). Learned to loop through multiple HTML elements and change their styles. Gained knowledge of basic DOM manipulation to show and hide elements.
Experiment 2.3 – Drawing Board Aim To create a simple drawing board using the HTML canvas where the user can draw using mouse actions. Observation Pressing the mouse button (mousedown) starts drawing. Moving the mouse while pressed draws lines on the canvas. Releasing the mouse button (mouseup) stops drawing. The drawing area has a blue border and works like a mini paint board. Learning Outcomes Learned to use mouse events like mousedown, mousemove, and mouseup. Understood how to draw lines on a canvas using JavaScript. Learned to read element attributes using getAttribute(). Gained hands-on experience with interactive graphics on a web page. This README explains the purpose, what happens when you run each part, and what you learned from building them.
